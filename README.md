## UnstableLandscape | Generativity and the Embodiments of Complexity

![Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 8 18 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170346044-60243b6e-7764-45ea-8253-1d4f76036ca2.png)

As a passionate interdisciplinary artist and researcher, I have been captivated by the intricacies of complexity theory and self-organizing systems for many years. My work blends improvisational and rule-based dance/arts, computational creativity, bottom-up architectures for cognition and embodiment, generative design, and p2p/blockchain technologies to create innovative and thought-provoking pieces.

In addition to my creative endeavors, I am also a sought-after teacher and consultant, working with universities, arts centers, corporations, festivals, and thinktanks to share my knowledge and experience.

My "Unstablelandscape" framework is a post-humanist epistemic integrative approach to shared practices, fields of inquiry, facilitation, and pedagogy. I bring this framework to life through a unique combination of improvisational/performance games, creative coding, XR/AR/Machine Learning, robotics, somatics, vipassana meditation, and generative design.

I have traveled across North, Central and South America, North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the UK, leading workshops and labs and empowering participants to explore their creativity through my expertise and guidance.
